        "I was the first born in our family; a happy and adorable child that loved to smile. Everyone seemed to be nice to me. It all changed when I was six, one morning when I stayed at my neighbors’ house to play with their children. I entered the living room and saw four women sitting and gossiping about things. I immediately apologized to them and turned around to leave. On my way out, I heard a woman shouting my mama’s name out loud. Curiously, I hid in one of the house’s corners and lent an ear to what the women were about to say. I heard something I wasn’t supposed to hear and discovered the truth that I knew was going to destroy my mental health. I found the “me” that I wasn’t going to be able to accept. As I stayed in that corner, happiness ran off my life and I couldn’t tell my parents about it since we weren’t that close.",

        "One of the worst hearsays I heard was about my dead twin brother who lived for only one week. He had died because of me and I was saved because of his death. After discovering the whole truth including that we were premature babies, it became hard for me to live without him because I was holding a grudge all alone. I started creating imaginary images and voices as if he was still around, thinking that I would stop feeling alone. This didn’t help me to feel any better.",

        "I started feeling useless, cheap, excluded from society and annoying. I hated everyone and everything that was around me. All people’s eyes were on me and I couldn’t handle the pressure of being a female as well as a first born. People expected me to be perfect and fix family issues that I was too young to fix, but I couldn’t handle that by myself. I started being too hard on myself at the age of 6 because I couldn’t satisfy their anticipations which made me think that I was not good enough. I started losing myself and overthinking. When I tried to ask for help, everyone (including my family) pushed me away even before I could open up and speak out about what I was going through. Others took it as a joke and used it to ‘double-kill’ me. I decided to keep it to myself.",

I lost myself, trying to become the person I was; not just to fit in and be normal like others. The only way to get through that was to know me first. ",

I created characters in my head and fell in love with them as a way of escaping love in reality, willing to live in wishes. That was the most unrequited love I have ever experienced.

Some people (including my family), perceived that I was dealing with depression and tried to help me when I started having phases. I spent four weeks taking therapy at the hospital but I couldn’t handle it. It felt like people were annoying my space when they started offering me life advice, persuading me that I should smile and stop taking life for granted. Nevertheless, this made me feel like I was the one to blame.  As days passed, I begged and forced my smile harder.",

I would either lose sleep and sometimes oversleep. During the daytime, I was a beauty full of hope but only God knows the hopeless beast I would turn into at 3 A.M. I loved the privacy and would claim for a private room, but my family would think that I was being selfish. They didn’t know that I didn't want anyone to see me at 3 a.m; awake and slowly dying. In my darkest years, I lost myself and interest in everything I loved and had worked for (including my dreams, goals and talents). I lost hope and became useless. I was just sitting there and waiting to see where the world will take me until death.",

I was afraid of losing myself again and return to the hell I had been stranded in before. I feared the public because my thoughts compelled me that it was difficult for people to accept the ‘me’ I wanted to be.  I knew that I was a hundred per cent different in my own way. 
      I almost stepped back until I meet Angelo, a stranger who inspired and helped me even before we met on Instagram He compelled me to focus on what I wanted and taught me to avoid pressure as well as to split up with my inner fear and stop being my own enemy. His words became a reason I got involved in art and motivated me to join the fight with a winning spirit. 
      He wasn't the first person to tell me such kind of words but he was a great listener and it was easy for me to open up because our conversation wasn’t face to face. He came at the right moment when I needed to hear his words. I took a step and started doing the only thing I loved in this world – art. Nevertheless, I couldn't figure out what to draw or write and tell the whole world. In my search, I found out that the young generation was facing depression, the same issue I was dealing with. 
      Inspired by the way Angelo had helped me, I opted to use my art to understand, tell, entertain, inspire and save other lost souls. Angelo became one of my daily inspirations.
